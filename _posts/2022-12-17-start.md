This post is to document list of steps that I performed to setup this website.
<br>

### Repository creation
Started with creating [repository](https://github.com/viksri/viksri.github.io) through github UI. Later cloned it on local system to customize it.
<br>

### Jekyll installation
Steps are pretty straightfoward as mentioned on [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). However I was unable to follow it because of different errors.
- When using existing version of ruby(2.4.10), jekyll installation failed because of error

```bash
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
The last version of public_suffix (>= 2.0.2, < 6.0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 4.0.7. Try installing it with `gem install public_suffix -v 4.0.7` and then running the current command again
public_suffix requires Ruby version >= 2.6. The current ruby version is 2.4.10.364.
```

- When upgraded ruby to latest version(3.1.3), jekyll installation went fine but all jekyll commands failed(including `jekyll -v`)

```bash
<internal:~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.1.3/lib/ruby/3.1.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb>:160:in 'require': cannot load such file -- kramdown (LoadError)
```

- After searching on web, found a link on web around jekyll not working with ruby 3.0 or higher. Finally moved to version 2.7.2 to fix both above issues

- Now installation was again failing with some error related to openssl

```bash
ERROR:  Error installing eventmachine:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
...
...
compiling binder.cpp
In file included from binder.cpp:20:
./project.h:119:10: fatal error: 'openssl/ssl.h' file not found
#include <openssl/ssl.h>
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
make: *** [binder.o] Error 1
```

- To fix that passed some custom flags for `eventmachine` installation

```bash
gem install eventmachine -v '1.2.7' -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/include --with-ldflags="-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup"
```

- Finally, jekyll was installed and `jekyll -v` was giving some valid output.

### Website creation

This was easiest part as I just had to run below command inside my repo folder
```bash
jekyll new --skip-bundle .
```
This created a bunch of files/folders in my repo
```bash
git/viksri.github.io (main *%) Â» ls
404.html     Gemfile.lock _config.yml     _sass        about.md     index.md
Gemfile      README.md    _site           assets
```
To check how website looked, I ran it locally
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

and website was up and running
```bash
Auto-regeneration: enabled for '~/git/viksri.github.io'
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

Next I quickly wrote up this post so that I dont forget these steps and pushed to github.
