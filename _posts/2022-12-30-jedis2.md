In [Jedis]({{ site.baseurl }}/jedis/) I covered most of basic operatiosn through jedis. In this post, writing down hashmap based operations.

### hashmap operations

Redis supportes storing hashmap against a string key. This is helpful in cases when we have to store multiple pieces of relevant information against same key.
An example could be details about a person which are saved against his unique id.

#### hset
This is used to save a specific field in hashmap against a key
```java
jedis.hset("person1", "name", "example");       // saving name of person1
jedis.hset("person1", "age", "12");             // saving age of person1
```

#### hmset
Instead of setting each field individually, we can also chose to save all of them together using `hmset`.
```java
jedis.hmset("person1", Map.of("name", "example", "age", "12"));      // saving name & age of person1
```

#### hkeys/hvalues
These methods can be used to retrieve fields/values stored against a key.
```java
var keys = jedis.hkeys("person1");              // keys will be [name, age]
var values = jedis.hvals("person1");            // values will be [example, 12]
```

#### hget
Although above methods do provide details about keys/values stored in hashmap, they do not provide details about what value is stored against what key.
This is where hget can be useful. If we want to know value against a particular key in hashmap, that can be retrieved using hget.
```java
var name = res.hget("person1", "name");         // name will be example
var age = res.hget("person1", "age");           // age will be 12
```

#### hmget
Instead of getting each field one by one, we could also retrieve all fields in a single call using `hmget`
```java
var details = res.hget("person1", "name", "age");         // details will be [example, 12]
```
